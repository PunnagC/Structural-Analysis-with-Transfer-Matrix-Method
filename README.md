This repository is part of many others used to successully run the primary MATLAB code [Dr. Punnag Chatterjee](https://sites.google.com/view/punnagchatterjee/home) between 2009 and 2013 in the Mechanical Engineering department at Boston University (Prof. Barba since moved to the George Washington University).

The structure of the MAIN (driver) code looks like this:

**Step 1: Structural**

a. reading geometry

b. reading material

c. structural simulation options

d. geometry discretization

e. structural module - evaluates mode shape and natural frequencies for bending/torsion

**Step 2: Electromechanical**

electromechanical module - evaluates the piezo-mechanical coupling parameters

**Step 3: Aerodynamic**

a. aerodynamic simulation options

b. creating aerodynamic matrices

**Step 4: Coupled - solution**

a. ode solver 

**Step 5: Post-processing**
